<p>I am a person. I have no life, and barely any friends. I like art, I like cats and I don't like homework. I spend my free time being lazy and procrastinating on my homework and assignments. Tomorrow I have a multimedia exam and I think that I am definitely going to fail it. Also, my throat keeps on randomly burning and I don't know why.</p>
